# fully_convolutional_change_detection

Fully convolutional network architectures for change detection using remote sensing images. 

The original papers [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8451652)[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08462) are about UNet, or patch-wise change detection on Onera Dataset. This repo also includes work on high resolution, pixel wise classification.

Onera Dataset is available [here](https://rcdaudt.github.io/oscd/) 24 pairs of images and labels over major cities. 

Another dataset detailed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.08452.pdf) is the [HRSCD - HIGH RESOLUTION SEMANTIC CHANGE DETECTION DATASET](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/hrscd-high-resolution-semantic-change-detection-dataset), which inclues 200+ high res 10K x 10K pixel images with semantic labeling, from which a set of 'change' labels has been constructed.
